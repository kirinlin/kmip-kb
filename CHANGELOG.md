# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **KMIP KB MCP server** (`mcp_server/kmip_kb_server.py`) — FastMCP server
  exposing the knowledge base over stdio with four tools: `search_kb` (BM25
  full-text search), `get_article` (full article retrieval), `list_articles`
  (front-matter-filtered listing), `get_related` (related-article discovery).
  Pre-wired for Claude Code via `.mcp.json` and `.claude/settings.json`; a
  `kmip-authoring` coding-agent skill added at `.claude/skills/kmip-authoring.md`.
- **59 new `kb/profiles/` stubs** generated from KMIP-Prof v1.0–v1.4 and v2.0:
  granular per-profile entries (basic/complete server variants, symmetric and
  asymmetric key foundry variants, certificate, secret data, storage, and
  discover-versions profiles), plus `quantum-safe-client.md`,
  `quantum-safe-server.md`, and `mandatory-quantum-safe-test-cases-kmip-v2-0.md`.
- `kb/versions/2.0-prof-toc.yaml`, `1.4-prof-toc.yaml`, `1.3-prof-toc.yaml`,
  `1.2-prof-toc.yaml`, `1.1-prof-toc.yaml`, `1.0-prof-toc.yaml` — KMIP-Prof
  section→file maps for all v1.x and v2.0 releases (8–44 sections each).
- `PROF_V1X_EARLY_RULES` and `get_prof_prefix_rules(version)` in
  `build_kb_scaffold.py` — handles v1.0–v1.2 KMIP-Prof documents where profile
  definitions sit in §4 (§5 is Conformance Clauses in those releases) rather
  than §5 as in v1.3+.
- **`enc-` prefix convention** for `v1_source_section` values that trace to the
  separate `[KMIP-ENCODE]` document (*KMIP Additional Message Encodings v1.0*);
  documented in `CLAUDE.md`. `v1_source_section: "enc-2/4/6"` added to
  `https-profiles.md`, `json-profiles.md`, and `xml-profiles.md` respectively,
  along with a Version History section in each article.
- **Suite B profile articles authored** (`stub → draft`): `suite-b-profiles.md`,
  `suite-b-minlos-128-authentication-suite.md`,
  `suite-b-minlos-192-authentication-suite.md` — covering v1.0–v1.4, sourced
  from the standalone `kmip-suite-b-profile/v1.0` companion and KMIP-Prof
  §3.3/§3.4/§5.13; includes P-256/P-384 algorithm table, cipher-suite
  requirements, NSA deprecation note (2017), and absence from KMIP-Prof v2.0+.
- **Enriched 7 use-case profile articles** from standalone companion docs
  (`kmip-*-profile/v1.0`): added test case naming convention, Permitted Test
  Case Variations sections, conformance asymmetry rules (client vs. server pass
  requirements), and v1.x provenance notes to `asymmetric-key-lifecycle-profiles.md`,
  `cryptographic-profiles.md`, `opaque-managed-object-store-profiles.md`,
  `storage-array-with-self-encrypting-drives-profiles.md`
  (including Template-removal and capacity deltas),
  `symmetric-key-foundry-for-fips-140-profiles.md`,
  `symmetric-key-lifecycle-profiles.md`, and `tape-library-profiles.md`
  (including VENDOR-LIBRARY-LTO namespace and x-Barcode Custom Attribute).
- **17 new `kb/profiles/` articles** sourced from the KMIP Profiles document
  ([KMIP-Prof] v2.1, separate from KMIP-SPEC):
  - Authentication suites: `basic-authentication-suite.md`,
    `https-authentication-suite.md`
  - Base/encoding profiles: `base-profiles.md`, `complete-server-profile.md`,
    `https-profiles.md`, `xml-profiles.md`, `json-profiles.md`
  - Key-management use-case profiles: `symmetric-key-lifecycle-profiles.md`,
    `symmetric-key-foundry-for-fips-140-profiles.md`,
    `asymmetric-key-lifecycle-profiles.md`, `cryptographic-profiles.md`,
    `opaque-managed-object-store-profiles.md`,
    `storage-array-with-self-encrypting-drives-profiles.md`,
    `tape-library-profiles.md`, `aes-xts-profiles.md`,
    `quantum-safe-profiles.md` (§5.14–5.17 consolidated),
    `pkcs-11-profiles.md`
  - `kb/profiles/index.md` updated with links to all articles.
- `kb/versions/2.1-prof-toc.yaml` — machine-readable section→file map for
  KMIP-Prof v2.1 (20 profile-family entries from §3 and §5).
- **`build_kb_scaffold.py --source prof`** flag: scaffolds from the KMIP-Prof
  document instead of KMIP-SPEC. Adds `PROF_PREFIX_RULES` (§3 auth suites,
  §5 profile definitions at depth 2), `prof_path_for()` resolver, and writes
  TOC to `<ver>-prof-toc.yaml`. Stubs emitted with `source_section: "prof-N.M"`.
- **`check_verbatim.py`** now resolves `prof-*` `source_section` values against
  the KMIP-Prof document rather than KMIP-SPEC.

### Fixed
- `spec_versions` in `schemas/index.md` and `schemas/agent/index.md` narrowed
  to `["1.0"]`; these are project-level index files, not versioned spec content.
- Typo in `symmetric-key-foundry-for-fips-140-profiles.md`: attribute name
  corrected from `Protect Stop Date` to `Process Stop Date`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- `Makefile`: `report` target runs `scripts/status_report.py`; `crawl` target
  runs `scripts/kmip_crawler.py` (extracted from old `build`).
- `versions/2.0-toc.yaml` (215 sections) and `versions/2.1-toc.yaml` (234
  sections) — generated section→file maps for KMIP v2.0 and v2.1.
  `scripts/build_kb_scaffold.py` extended with `V20_PREFIX_RULES` (v2.x has a
  completely different section numbering from v1.x) and `spec_path_for()`
  updated to resolve `raw/kmip/kmip-spec/v<ver>/os/` for v2.x.
- Full per-release delta notes in `versions/index.md` for v2.0 and v2.1:
  - **v2.0**: structural renumbering, 9 new client-to-server operations
    (Adjust Attribute, Delegated Login, Interop, Log, Login/Logout, PKCS#11,
    Re-Provision, Set Attribute, Set Endpoint Role), 2 new server-to-client
    operations, Certificate Request object, 5 new attributes (NIST Key Type,
    Protection Level/Period/Storage Mask, Quantum Safe, Short Unique
    Identifier), §5 Attribute Data Structures overhaul, §10.2 alternate wire
    formats, and removal of Template, deprecated cert attributes, and
    Operation Policy Name.
  - **v2.1**: 7 Rotate* key-rotation policy attributes, constraints sub-system
    (Get/Set Constraints + Constraint/Constraints structures), asynchronous-
    request management (Query Asynchronous Requests + companion structures),
    and Ping/Process/Set Defaults utility operations.
- `spec_versions` front matter updated across all 162 KB docs: "2.0" added
  to all docs whose feature is present in v2.0; "2.1" added to all docs
  carrying "2.0" (v2.1 is purely additive). Five docs correctly excluded from
  both (removed in v2.0): `objects/template.md`, `attributes/certificate-
  identifier/subject/issuer.md`, `attributes/operation-policy-name.md`.
- `versions/1.0-toc.yaml`, `versions/1.1-toc.yaml`, `versions/1.2-toc.yaml`,
  `versions/1.3-toc.yaml` — generated section→file maps for KMIP v1.0–v1.3,
  produced by `scripts/build_kb_scaffold.py --version <ver> --toc-only`
  (section counts: 104 / 112 / 134 / 143 respectively). All five 1.x releases
  now have committed ToC maps.
- Full per-release delta notes in `versions/index.md` covering v1.1–v1.3 (v1.4
  summary unchanged), each section linking to the relevant KB docs:
  - **v1.1**: X.509 certificate attribute expansion and deprecations, Discover
    Versions, Re-key Key Pair, Extension Information, Encoding Option.
  - **v1.2**: 11 cryptographic service operations (Encrypt/Decrypt, Sign/Verify,
    MAC/MAC Verify, RNG Retrieve/Seed, Hash), Create/Join Split Key, PGP Key
    object, 5 crypto-op structures (Data, Data Length, Signature Data, MAC Data,
    Nonce), 4 attributes, and the full attestation story (Attestation credential
    type, Nonce challenge/response, Attestation Capable Indicator, Query
    Attestation Types).
  - **v1.3**: streaming multi-part crypto (Correlation Value, Init/Final
    Indicator), capability reporting structures (RNG Parameters, Profile/
    Validation/Capability Information), Random Number Generator attribute,
    server-to-client Query, and deprecations (Template, Operation Policy Name,
    legacy Transparent EC key forms).
- `spec_versions` front matter verified against ToC diffs across all 53
  version-boundary docs (v1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 new sections); 0 errors found.
- Authored all remaining stub content (119 docs) as original prose
  (`status: draft`), bringing the knowledge base to 100% draft coverage
  (158 content docs, 0 stubs):
  - `attributes/` — all 51 attributes (§3.1–§3.51) plus a grouped index:
    data types and structure tables, constraints (instance rules, mutability,
    lifecycle freezing), applies-to object types, and set/modified-by rules;
    `spec_versions` computed per attribute across v1.0–v1.4.
  - `ttlv/` — all 45 docs covering §2.1 base objects, §6 message contents,
    §7 message format, and §9.1 TTLV encoding, with tag hex values from the
    §9.1.3.1 registry, plus a structured index.
  - `concepts/` — authentication, transport, and error handling, plus index.
  - `operations/` — the three server-to-client operations (Notify, Put, and
    the v1.3+ Query) with their index, and a categorized top-level
    operations index.
  - `profiles/` — server and client implementation conformance plus index.
  - `references/` — IPR policy, terminology, normative and non-normative
    references, plus index.
  - Index pages for `examples/`, `mappings/`, `workflows/`, and `versions/`,
    each listing planned content.
  - Validated by `build_kb_scaffold.py --check`, `validate_links.py`, and
    `check_verbatim.py` (all categories clean; `operations/re-key.md`
    remains manual-review-only because §4.4's heading was lost in source
    conversion).
- Authored all 9 managed object types plus the category index (`objects/*.md`)
  as original prose (`status: draft`): purpose, structure, key attributes,
  lifecycle/state, and cross-references into `operations/`, `attributes/`, and
  `ttlv/`. `spec_versions` reflect availability per type (PGP Key from v1.2;
  Template present v1.0–v1.4 but deprecated in v1.3). Verified clean by
  `check_verbatim.py`.
- Authored all 41 client-to-server operations (`operations/*.md`) as original
  prose (`status: draft`): purpose, request/response fields, behavior, errors,
  and cross-references, with `spec_versions` computed per operation across
  v1.0–v1.4. Includes `operations/re-key.md` (§4.4), whose heading was lost in
  source conversion and which is therefore not produced by the generator.
- `scripts/check_verbatim.py` — no-verbatim guard that flags any shared 8+-word
  run between an authored doc and its `source_section` in the raw spec.
- `--prune` mode on `scripts/build_kb_scaffold.py` — removes orphaned stub files
  no longer produced by the rules (never touches `draft`/`reviewed` docs).
- `--skip-file` option on `scripts/kmip_crawler.py` (default `./raw/404skip.txt`)
  — skips URLs listed in the file, e.g. known 404s, before download; a missing
  file is ignored.
- Knowledge-base scaffold targeting the KMIP 1.x family (baseline v1.4):
  directory structure (`concepts/`, `operations/` + `operations/server-to-client/`,
  `objects/`, `attributes/`, `ttlv/`, `profiles/`, `workflows/`, `examples/`,
  `schemas/` + `schemas/agent/`, `mappings/`, `versions/`, `references/`).
- `scripts/build_kb_scaffold.py` — pure-stdlib generator that parses a raw 1.x
  spec, classifies each section, and emits one stub per section, an `index.md`
  per directory, and `versions/<ver>-toc.yaml`. Modes: `--check`, `--toc-only`,
  `--no-stubs`, `--version`, `--spec`, `--out`. Never overwrites a file whose
  `status` is no longer `stub`.
- 157 section stubs + per-directory index files generated from KMIP v1.4
  (front matter + headers only; no specification prose).
- `schemas/frontmatter.schema.json` — JSON Schema for document front matter,
  enforced by the generator's `--check` mode.
- `templates/` — document skeletons (operation, attribute, object, concept,
  ttlv, reference) plus `agent-relations.yaml` for GraphRAG relation files.
- `versions/1.4-toc.yaml` — generated section→file map for KMIP v1.4.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — content rules, the no-verbatim rule, authoring workflow,
  and review checklist.

### Changed
- `Makefile`: `build` target is now a stub (`echo "Coming Soon"`).
- `.gitignore`: removed `docs/` exclusion so a generated `docs/` directory can
  be tracked.
- **Repo restructured: all KB content moved under `kb/`.** The 11 content
  directories (`attributes`, `concepts`, `examples`, `mappings`, `objects`,
  `operations`, `profiles`, `references`, `ttlv`, `versions`, `workflows`)
  now live under `kb/`; the root retains only `schemas/`, `templates/`, and
  `scripts/`. Scripts updated: `CATEGORY_DIR` and `STRUCTURE_DIRS` in
  `build_kb_scaffold.py`, `CONTENT_DIRS` in `status_report.py`,
  `ALL_KB_DIRS` in `validate_links.py`, and the default path in
  `check_verbatim.py`. Cross-links in `kb/workflows`, `kb/examples`, and
  `kb/mappings` index pages corrected for their new sibling position inside
  `kb/`. `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated throughout.
- **Baseline moved from v1.4 to v2.1.** Each doc now carries both
  `source_section` (the v2.1 baseline section) and a new optional
  `v1_source_section` (the v1.x section for the same concept, e.g.
  `attributes/link.md` → `source_section: "4.31"`, `v1_source_section: "3.35"`).
  The five docs removed in v2.0 carry `source_section: "del_v2"` with their last
  v1.x section in `v1_source_section`. v2.x-only features (no v1 mapping) omit
  `v1_source_section`. The schema, `build_kb_scaffold.py` (render + validate),
  and `check_verbatim.py` (anchors `del_v2` docs against their v1.x section)
  were updated accordingly.
  `source_section` front matter is now v2.1 section numbering: 142 docs renumbered from the committed
  `versions/2.1-toc.yaml` (e.g. `operations/create.md` §4.1 → §6.1.8,
  `attributes/name.md` §3.2 → §4.32, `ttlv/key-block.md` §2.1.3 → §3.1), plus
  renamed/restructured docs mapped by hand (client/server correlation values →
  §9.9/§9.10, `ttlv/ttlv-encoding.md` → §10.1, `concepts/error-handling.md` →
  no discrete v2.x section). `spec_version` set to `"2.1"` on every doc present
  in v2.1. The five docs removed in v2.0 (`objects/template.md`,
  `attributes/certificate-identifier/subject/issuer.md`,
  `attributes/operation-policy-name.md`) keep their last-present v1.x
  baseline and numbering.
- `scripts/build_kb_scaffold.py` `--version` default changed `1.4` → `2.1`.
- Baseline declarations updated in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the
  `schemas/frontmatter.schema.json` example; CLAUDE.md's section→category map
  now leads with v2.1 numbering.
- In-body `§` cross-references across ~20 content docs re-anchored to v2.1
  numbering (v1.x noted where useful) — references, profiles, concepts,
  operations/attributes/ttlv index pages, and the `protocol-version` /
  `ttlv-encoding` / `operation(s)` / `result-reason` / `attribute` structures.
  Version-negotiation examples in `ttlv/protocol-version.md` now use 2.x.
- Reworded five field-table rows (`attributes/digest`, `link`,
  `revocation-reason`; `operations/export`, `get-usage-allocation`) to keep
  the no-verbatim guard green against the v2.1 source, which it now checks.
- Meta/index pages (`examples`, `mappings`, `workflows`, `schemas`,
  `schemas/agent` indexes) extended to the full `spec_versions` range; document
  skeletons in `templates/` rebased to `spec_version: "2.1"`,
  `spec_versions: ["2.1"]`.
- `README.md` rewritten knowledge-base-first; the crawler is documented as
  secondary, private source-preparation tooling.
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with the knowledge-base layout, the scaffold generator,
  the front-matter contract, and the no-verbatim rule.

### Fixed
- `scripts/kmip_crawler.py` now prunes paths in `EXCLUDE_PREFIXES` from both the
  crawl and any `--urls` list, starting with the
  `kmip-profiles/v3.0/csd01/test-cases/kmip-v3.0` subtree that self-references
  into runaway depth from server mis-linking.
- Removed two orphaned operation stubs (`operations/notify.md`,
  `operations/put.md`) left at the top level before server-to-client routing
  existed; the correct copies live under `operations/server-to-client/`.
